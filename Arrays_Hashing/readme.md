# Arrays & Hashing

- [x] **Contains Duplicate**

  - https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/
  - Refresher: Correct use of DS like [**std::set**] (https://cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/) taking advantage of the std implementation of insert property of a hash array like.
  - Time complexity: O(n)
  - Space complexity: O(n)

- [x] **Valid Anagram**

  - https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/
  - Refresher: Create a vector of pairs representing the alphabet, then iterate over the strings and use the vector as counter of occurences, the final sum of the vector should be zero.
  - Time complexity: O(n)
  - Space complexity: O(n)

- [x] **Two Sum**

  - https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
  - Refresher: this problem requires the implementation of a binary search. The trick is iterate the array and store the complement to get to the target. then look if the complement all ready exist.
  - Time complexity: O(n)
  - Space complexity: O(n)

- [x] **Group Anagrams**

  - https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/
  - Refresher: Use a map to take advantage of the insert method, slightly different than the easy variation of valid anagram since this one require a strict sort of the string for the map key comparison.
  - Time complexity: O()
  - Space complexity: O(NK)

- [] **Top K Frequent Elements**

  - https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/
  - Refresher: Build a map of frequencies and then sort.
  - Time complexity:O()
  - Space complexity:O()
  - Notes: theres a better implementation using a heap , refer to the editorial https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/editorial/.

- [] **Product of Array Except Self**

  - https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/
  - Refresher:
  - Time complexity:
  - Space complexity:

- [] **Encode and Decode Strings**

  - https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/
  - Refresher:
  - Time complexity:
  - Space complexity:

- [] **Longest Consecutive Sequence**
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/
  - Refresher:
  - Time complexity:
  - Space complexity:
