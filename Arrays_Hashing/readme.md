# Arrays & Hashing

- [x] **Contains Duplicate**
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/
  - Refresher: Correct use of DS like [**std::set**] (https://cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/) taking advantage of the std implementation of insert property of a hash array like.
  - Time complexity: O(n)
  - Space complexity: O(n)

- [x] **Valid Anagram**
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/
  - Refresher: Create a vector of pairs representing the alphabet, then iterate over the strings and use the vector as counter of occurences, the final sum of the vector should be zero.
  - Time complexity: O(n)
  - Space complexity: O(n)

- [x] **Two Sum**
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
  - Refresher: this problem requires the implementation of a binary search. The trick is iterate the array and store the complement to get to the target. then look if the complement all ready exist.
  - Time complexity: O(n)
  - Space complexity: O(n)
